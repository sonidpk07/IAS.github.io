Hindu Samhati Workers Arrested To Appease Muslims
Our 3 workers Judhisthir Mondal, Rajkumar Sardar & Joydeb Naiya have been arrested on 26th October night by Mathurapur police (South 24 Parganas) as they went to help Hindu victims at Taluk Ranaghata area. Their name was nowhere mentioned in the FIR yet they were arrested to appease Muslims. They were produced to Diamond Harbour SDJM court on 26th. In a unprecedented way, they were given 28 days of Judicial Custody and the next date of hearing will be 23rd November. Mathurapur police could not protect the Hindus' life, property & women's honor day before yesterday night. They are in collusion with the notorious dacoits & criminals of Lalpur anchal. Hindus of Ranaghata village have been repeatedly becoming victim of criminals of Lalpur. Shame on Mathurapur police.
