You will never believe why Akhilesh Yadav will stay away from PM Modi's event
Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister is unlikely to attend Prime Minister Narendra Modi's programme in Noida on December 31, owing to the so-called "Noida jinx". "In the meeting to review preparations for the PM's visit, Panchyati Raj Minister Kailash Yadav was nominated to represent the CM in Noida. Arrangement has been made on the dias for the minister (in place of CM)," IG, Law and Order A Satish Ganesh told reporters when asked about possibility of Akhilesh visiting Noida. "As of now, only the minister will be attending PM's programme," he said.

Noida jinx, as per political circles, has in the past caught up with several chief ministers of Uttar Pradesh, including Veer Bahadur Singh, Narayan Dutt Tiwari, Kalyan Singh and Mayawati, who lost their chairs soon after visiting Noida.

The jinx started in 1988 when former chief minister Vir Bahadur Singh lost power within days of visiting Noida in 1988. Later in 1997, Mayawati lost power after visiting Noida. Earlier, in 1989, ND Tiwari and 10 years later, in 1999, Kalyan Singh suffered the same fate. In 1995, Mulayam was out of power within months of his Noida visit.

The last one was Mayawati, who lost power in 2012 assembly elections after she flew down to Noida in October 2011 to inaugurate the Dalit Prerna Sthal. In August 2012, CM Akhilesh Yadav inaugurated the Yamuna Expressway from Lucknow and avoided travelling to Noida. The following year, he inaugurated infrastructure projects in Gautam Buddh Nagar without visiting the city.

In 2001, the then UP CM Rajnath Singh inaugurated the DND flyway from Delhi, but did not visit Noida. PM Modi is scheduled to visit Noida to lay the foundation of Delhi-Meerut Expressway on December 31.
