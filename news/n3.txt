Maa Durga's Idol Desecrated At Sodepur, Hooghly
Reports of several incidents regarding desecration of Maa Durga's idol are coming from different areas of the State. In the most cases, when reported, police is apathetic to catch the perpetrators and advising the complainants to disturb communal harmony.Last night, idols of Ganesha, Laxmi, Sarawati & Kartik were thrashed at Sodepur under Pursura PS in the district of Hooghly. Hindus in that area became very furious and they approached police to nab culprits. Surprisingly, police advised them not to make a issue of it and offered them financial assistance. Villagers strongly refused the offer and organized road-block demanding arrest of the culprits. The blockade was withdrawn later after police assured them of arresting the culprits.
